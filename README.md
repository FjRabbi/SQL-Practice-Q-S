Questions 7: 
We are looking for a specific patient. Pull all columns for the patient who matches the following criteria:
- First_name contains an 'r' after the first two letters.
- Identifies their gender as 'F'
- Born in February, May, or December
- Their weight would be between 60kg and 80kg
- Their patient_id is an odd number
- They are from the city 'Kingston'
Solution:
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE (first_name LIKE '__r%')
  AND (gender = 'F')
  AND (MONTH (birth_date) = 2 OR MONTH (birth_date) = 5 OR MONTH (birth_date) = 12)
  AND (weight BETWEEN 60 AND 80)
  AND (patient_id % 2 = 1)
  AND (city = 'Kingston');






Or,
SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE
  first_name LIKE '__r%'
  AND gender = 'F'
  AND MONTH (birth_date) IN (2, 5, 12)
  AND weight BETWEEN 60 AND 80
  AND patient_id % 2 = 1
  AND city = 'Kingston';

Questions 8: 
Show the percent of patients that have 'M' as their gender. Round the answer to the nearest hundredth number and in percent form.
Solution:
SELECT
  CONCAT (ROUND (  (
        SUM (CASE 
WHEN gender = 'M' THEN 1 
ELSE NULL 
END) / CAST (
COUNT (*) AS float) * 100), 2), '%') AS percent_of_male_patients
FROM patients;


Or,
SELECT CONCAT (ROUND (
      (
        SELECT COUNT (*)
        FROM patients
        WHERE gender = 'M'
      ) / CAST (COUNT (*) AS float),4) * 100, '%') AS percent_of_male_patients
FROM patients;


Or,
SELECT
  ROUND (100 * AVG (gender = 'M'), 2) || '%' AS percent_of_male_patients
FROM patients;


Or,
SELECT 
   CONCAT (ROUND (SUM (gender='M') / CAST (COUNT (*) AS float), 4) * 100, '%')
FROM patients;




Questions 9: 
For each day display the total amount of admissions on that day. Display the amount changed from the previous date.
Solution:
SELECT admission_date,
  COUNT (admission_date) AS admission_day, 
  (COUNT (*) â€“ LAG (COUNT (*)) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date)) AS admissions_change
FROM admissions
GROUP BY admission_date;

Or,
WITH admission_counts_table AS (
  SELECT admission_date, COUNT (patient_id) AS admission_count
  FROM admissions
  GROUP BY admission_date
  ORDER BY admission_date DESC
)
SELECT
  admission_date, 
  admission_count, 
  admission_count â€“ LAG (admission_count) OVER (ORDER BY admission_date) AS admission_count_change 
FROM admission_counts_table;

Questions 10: 
Sort the province names in ascending order in such a way that the province 'Ontario' is always on top.
Solution:
SELECT   province_name
FROM province_names
ORDER BY (CASE WHEN province_name='Ontario' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END),
province_name ASC;

Or,
SELECT province_name
FROM province_names
ORDER BY
  (NOT province_name = 'Ontario'),
  province_name;

Or,
SELECT province_name
FROM province_names
ORDER BY
  province_name = 'Ontario' DESC,
  province_name;
